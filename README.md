# Journeyers
Most of our lives are spent in teams: household, school, workplace. . . .<br>
Our appreciability in these teams, and therefore our quality of life, depends on our ability to group problem-solve toward lasting solutions.

This open source ed tech and assistive tech, proof-of-concept project <br>
(built with Flutter, therefore cross-platform [Android, iPhone, Linux, macOS, Windows], <br>
and with a goal of being multilingual, accessible, and offline-friendly), <br>
is meant to support our group problem-solving processes, and to help us reach lasting solutions.<br>
<br>
Illustrational value should be findable in the utils, custom widgets, and custom widgets testing files.<br>
The answers to the first set of questions is exportable to CSV. <br>
The dashboard supports previewing, sorting by date, keyword filtering and deletion.<br>
([apk - alpha release](https://github.com/jlmacle/journeyers_releases/blob/main/app-release-260211.apk)) <br>
An English/French localization proof-of-concept is illustrated (unfinished and commented in homepage.dart).<br>
Additional effort needs to be done for the accessibility.<br>
([Flutter install](https://docs.flutter.dev/install))

Should we entrust the harmony of our households,<br>
or our work/life balance,<br>
to lose-win decision-making patterns?<br>
Should we entrust our lives<br>
to our potentially incomplete education on the matter,<br>
or should we complete our education?<br><br>
