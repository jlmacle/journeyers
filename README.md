Most of our lives are spent in teams: household, school, workplace.<br>
Our appreciability in these teams, and therefore our quality of life, depends on our ability to problem-solve toward lasting solutions.

This open source ed tech and assistive tech project (cross-platform app) is meant to support our problem-solving processes, and to help us reach lasting solutions.
