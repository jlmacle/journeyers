# Journeyers
Most of our lives are spent in teams: household, school, workplace.<br>
Our appreciability in these teams, and therefore our quality of life, depends on our ability to problem-solve toward lasting solutions.

This open source ed tech and assistive tech, proof-of-concept project (cross-platform, cross-cultural, accessible, offline-friendly app), is meant to support our problem-solving processes, and to help us reach lasting solutions.
As of 12/06/25, most of the value is in the utils, custom widgets, and custom widgets testing files.
The answers to the first set of questions is exportable to CSV.
