# Journeyers
Most of our lives are spent in teams: household, school, workplace.<br>
Our appreciability in these teams, and therefore our quality of life, depends on our ability to problem-solve toward lasting solutions.

This open source ed tech and assistive tech, proof-of-concept project <br>
(with a goal of being cross-platform, cross-cultural, accessible, and offline-friendly), <br>
is meant to support our problem-solving processes, and to help us reach lasting solutions.<br>
<br>
As of 12/06/25, most of the value is in the utils, custom widgets, and custom widgets testing files.<br>
The answers to the first set of questions is exportable to CSV.

Should we entrust the harmony of our households,<br>
or our work/life balance,<br>
to lose-win decision-making patterns?<br>
Should we entrust our lives<br>
to our potentially incomplete education on the matter,<br>
or should we complete our education?<br><br>
