Persist permissions
"When your app opens a file for reading or writing, 
the system gives your app a URI permission grant for that file, 
which lasts until the user's device restarts. 
Suppose, however, that your app is an image-editing app, 
and you want users to be able to access the 5 images that they most recently edited, 
directly from your app. If the user's device has restarted, 
you'd have to send the user back to the system picker to find the files."

"The ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE intent action, available on Android 5.0 (API level 21) and higher, 
allows users to select a specific directory, 
granting your app access to all of the files and sub-directories within that directory."
