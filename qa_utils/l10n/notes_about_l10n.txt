"iOS Applications

iOS applications define key application metadata, including supported locales, 
in an Info.plist file that is built into the application bundle. 
To configure the locales supported by your app, you’ll need to edit this file.
First, open your project’s ios/Runner.xcworkspace Xcode workspace file. 
Then, in the Project Navigator, open the Info.plist file under the Runner project’s Runner folder.
Next, select the Information Property List item, select Add Item from the Editor menu, 
then select Localizations from the pop-up menu.
Select and expand the newly-created Localizations item then, for each locale your application supports, 
add a new item and select the locale you wish to add from the pop-up menu in the Value field. 
This list should be consistent with the languages listed in the AppLocalizations.supportedLocales property."
